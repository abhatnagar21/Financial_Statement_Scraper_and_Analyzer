**Financial Analysis Project using Python**

This project is designed to facilitate the extraction, storage, and analysis of financial data from publicly traded companies using Python. The primary focus is on analyzing key financial statements—such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement—and calculating important financial ratios that can help in assessing a company's financial health.

**Key Features:**

**Automated Data Extraction:**
Leverages the yfinance library to download financial data directly from Yahoo Finance by simply providing a stock ticker symbol.

**Excel Export:**
Saves the extracted financial data into an organized Excel file, making it easy to share or perform further analysis.

**Financial Analysis:**
Computes essential financial ratios like the current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and profit margin.

**Investment Insights**:
Provides a basic assessment of the company’s financial health based on the calculated ratios, offering a preliminary view on whether the company might be a good investment opportunity.

**Technologies and Tools:**

**Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the project.
**yfinance:** A Python library used for extracting financial data from Yahoo Finance.
**pandas:** A data analysis library that handles data manipulation and calculation of financial metrics.

**Project Workflow:**

**Extract Financial Data:**

The script retrieves data for a given stock ticker symbol.
It pulls data for the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

**Save Data to Excel:**

The retrieved data is stored in a structured Excel file with separate sheets for each financial statement.

****Analyze Financial Data:**
**
The project calculates key financial ratios to assess the company's financial health.
A decision-making framework is provided based on these ratios, offering insights into whether the company is financially healthy and potentially worth investing in.
